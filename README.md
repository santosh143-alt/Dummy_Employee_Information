**GitHub Project Description: Employee Information Display Script**

**Overview:**
This Python script, part of a GitHub project, serves as an Employee Information Display System. Leveraging the Faker module, Random module, and Tabulate library, it generates realistic employee data and presents it in a tabulated format. The script enables users to view essential details of employees, including their employee number, name, salary, address, mobile number, email, department, date of joining, and age. The project aims to provide a simple yet effective tool for showcasing randomly generated employee information.

**Features:**

1. **Randomly Generated Employee Data:**
   - Using both the Faker module and the Random module, the script generates diverse and realistic employee data, ensuring authenticity and variability in the information presented.

2. **Tabulated Display:**
   - Utilizing the Tabulate library, the script organizes the employee data into a clear and structured table format, enhancing readability and ease of interpretation for users.

3. **Comprehensive Employee Details:**
   - Users can access a comprehensive list of employee details, including employee number, name, salary, address, mobile number, email, department, date of joining, and age, facilitating a thorough understanding of each employee's profile.

**Usage:**
1. **Execute Script:**
   - Users can execute the script to generate and display a tabulated view of randomly generated employee information. The generated data encompasses various employee attributes, providing a rich and diverse dataset.

**Dependencies:**
- Faker module: A Python library for generating fake data, used to simulate employee information.
- Random module: A Python module for generating random numbers, used in conjunction with the Faker module to introduce variability in the generated data.
- Tabulate library: A Python library for formatting tabular data, employed to present the generated employee data in a structured manner.

**Note:** 
- This script focuses solely on displaying randomly generated employee information and does not include functionalities for modifying or deleting records.
- Users are encouraged to explore and contribute to the project, providing feedback, suggesting enhancements, or extending its functionality to suit their specific requirements.
